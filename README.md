Text-Based Battleship Game in C++
Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Battleship game in C++. The game is entirely text-based and runs in the console. Players can take turns to guess the coordinates of the opponent's ships and try to sink them.

Game Rules

    The game is played on a 10x10 grid.
    Each player has a fleet of ships, including an aircraft carrier (5 cells), battleship (4 cells), cruiser (3 cells), submarine (3 cells), and destroyer (2 cells).
    Players take turns to enter coordinates to target a cell on the opponent's grid.
    The game provides feedback on whether the shot was a hit or a miss.
    The game ends when all ships of one player are sunk.
